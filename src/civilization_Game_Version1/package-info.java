 * In this package there are classes which together maintain the purpose of this exercise.Using object-oriented 
 * programming techniques,this program operates a small part of the real "Civilization" Game.The program uses 
 * methods/functions for operating  and objects for creating a simulation of the game,in order to represent all the 
 * moves,actions,places and generally the game.Moreover this program was made in order to define the role of the
 * object oriented power of the java language not only in creating games,but also solving every possible problem
 * which has a solution!It combines the objects between them in order to use them from main method in class 
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version1.CivilizationGame} and complete its purpose from main class.The main class plays a big role 
 * because in this program controls all the operations and functions of this program.
 * So This package contains sixteen(16) classes.Each class represents
 * a unique thing and has its own attributes and operations!The classes are:  
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version1.Building}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version1.CoalMine}
 * {@linkplain civilization_Game_Version1.Desert}
